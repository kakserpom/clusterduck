## Installation

[Clusterduck] is required.

```
npm i -g clusterduck-http
```

## Configuration

Let's define a HTTP cluster named `my_web_cluster`:

```yaml
# clusters:

my_http_cluster:
  type: clusterduck-http
```

### Nodes

Then let's define some nodes:

```yaml
    # List of nodes
    nodes:
      - addr: 1.1.1.1:80
      - addr: 2.2.2.2:80
```

*Note that you can omit this altogether if you want to only add nodes dynamically.*

### Health checks

If you do not want to use health checks, use:

```yaml
    pass_without_checks: true
```

Otherwise, define the `health_checks` array:

```yaml
    health_checks:
```

#### WebSocket

```yaml
      - type: websocket
        timeout: 5s
        every: 10s
        url: wss://your-domain/websocket/
        every: 1000s
        timeout: 20s
        flow:
          - type: expect_json       # Expect a JSON packet
            skip_forward: true      # Ignore prior unexpected packets
            match:                  # Match conditions [path, eq|exists, ?right]
              - [ response.text, eq, "Knock-knock."] 
              - [ timestamp ]       # 'timestamp' field exists

          - type: send_json
            body: {query: {text: "Who's there?"}}

          - type: expect_json
            match:                
              - [ response.text, eq, "Amish."]

          - type: send_json
            body: {query: {text: "Amish who?"}}

          - type: expect_json
            match:                
              - [ response.text, eq, "Really? You donâ€™t look like a shoe!"]

```

>Note that DNS lookups get overridden, so `your-domain` will be resolved 
> to an IP-address corresponding to one of the nodes in your cluster.
> However, `Host` header will be set to `your-domain`.


### HAProxy balancer

[HAProxy] is required to be installed.

Let's write up a config:

```yaml
  balancers:

    my_balancer:
      type: haproxy
      listen: 0.0.0.0:443

``` 

> *Note:* `clusterduck` will run  `haproxy` with an according configuration.
> [Hot restarting] works out-of-box so that `HAProxy` is always kept in __sync__ with `clusterduck`.
> It requires no middleware or additional configuration.

## Debug

For debugging purposes use `DEBUG` environmental variable:
`DEBUG=haproxy clusterduck`

## Dependencies

- [clusterduck]

### HAProxy balancer
